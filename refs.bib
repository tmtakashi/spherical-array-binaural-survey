headphones is presented. Binaural sound reproduction requires
filtering of virtual sources with head related transfer
functions (HRTFs). To improve source localization capabilities
head tracking as well as room simulation have to be
incorporated. This yields the problem of high-quality
time-varying interpolation between different HRTFs. The proposed
solution uses a virtual ambisonic approach that results in time
invariant HRTF filter.",

  H{\"o}ldrich, Robert",
  abstract = "Binaural rendering of Ambisonic signals is of great interest in
  the fields of virtual reality, immersive media, and virtual
  acoustics. Typically, the spatial order of head-related impulse
  responses (HRIRs) is considerably higher than the order of the
  Ambisonic signals. The resulting order reduction of the HRIRs has
  a detrimental effect on the binaurally rendered signals, and
  perceptual evaluations indicate limited externalization,
  localization accuracy, and altered timbre. In this contribution,
  a binaural renderer, which is computed using a
  frequency-dependent time alignment of HRIRs followed by a
  minimization of the squared error subject to a diffuse-field
  covariance matrix constraint, is presented. The
  frequency-dependent time alignment retains the interaural time
  difference (at low frequencies) and results in a HRIR set with
  lower spatial complexity, while the constrained optimization
  controls the diffuse-field behavior. Technical evaluations in
  terms of sound coloration, interaural level differences,
  diffuse-field response, and interaural coherence, as well as
  findings from formal listening experiments show a significant
  improvement of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art
  methods.",

abstract  = "The head related transfer function (HRTF) characterizes the
scattering properties of a person's anatomy (especially the
pinnae, head and torso), and exhibits considerable
person-to-person variability. It is usually measured as a part
of a tedious experiment, and this leads to the function being
sampled at a few angular locations. When the HRTF is needed at
intermediate angles, its value must be interpolated. Further,
its range dependence is also neglected, which is invalid for
nearby sources. Since the HRTF arises from a scattering process,
it can be characterized as a solution of a scattering problem.
In this paper, we show that by taking this viewpoint and
performing some analysis we can express the HRTF in terms of a
series of multipole solutions of the Helmholtz equation. This
approach leads to a natural solution to the problem of HRTF
interpolation. Furthermore, we show that the range-dependence of
the HRTF in the near-field can also be obtained by extrapolation
from measurements at one range.",

  spatial data captured by spherical microphone arrays has been
  recently proposed and investigated perceptually. The finite
  spatial resolution enforced by the microphone configuration
  restricts the available frequency bandwidth and, accordingly,
  modifies the perceived timbre of the played-back material. This
  paper presents a feasibility study investigating the use of
  filters to correct such spectral artifacts. Listening tests are
  employed to gain a better understanding of how equalization
  affects externalization, source focus and timbre. Preliminary
  results suggest that timbre correction filters improve both
  timbral and spatial perception.",

  the interaural cross-correlation (IACC) coefficient. Recently,
  spherical microphone arrays have been studied for room acoustics
  analysis and music recordings. This study presents a theoretical
  formulation for the computation of IACC using spherical-harmonics
  representations of the sound field, as measured by spherical
  microphone arrays, and spherical-harmonics representation of
  head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), taken from HRTF
  databases. As spherical microphone arrays typically use a finite
  number of microphones, they may not be able to capture the
  complete spatial information in a sound field. Therefore, the
  effect of limited spherical-harmonics order on the accuracy of
  IACC approximation using the proposed method is studied using
  simulated and measured data. The method presented in this paper
  can be further used to study the effect of limited spatial
  information on the spatial perception of sound fields.",
