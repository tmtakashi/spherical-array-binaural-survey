headphones is presented. Binaural sound reproduction requires
filtering of virtual sources with head related transfer
functions (HRTFs). To improve source localization capabilities
head tracking as well as room simulation have to be
incorporated. This yields the problem of high-quality
time-varying interpolation between different HRTFs. The proposed
solution uses a virtual ambisonic approach that results in time
invariant HRTF filter.",

  H{\"o}ldrich, Robert",
  abstract = "Binaural rendering of Ambisonic signals is of great interest in
  the fields of virtual reality, immersive media, and virtual
  acoustics. Typically, the spatial order of head-related impulse
  responses (HRIRs) is considerably higher than the order of the
  Ambisonic signals. The resulting order reduction of the HRIRs has
  a detrimental effect on the binaurally rendered signals, and
  perceptual evaluations indicate limited externalization,
  localization accuracy, and altered timbre. In this contribution,
  a binaural renderer, which is computed using a
  frequency-dependent time alignment of HRIRs followed by a
  minimization of the squared error subject to a diffuse-field
  covariance matrix constraint, is presented. The
  frequency-dependent time alignment retains the interaural time
  difference (at low frequencies) and results in a HRIR set with
  lower spatial complexity, while the constrained optimization
  controls the diffuse-field behavior. Technical evaluations in
  terms of sound coloration, interaural level differences,
  diffuse-field response, and interaural coherence, as well as
  findings from formal listening experiments show a significant
  improvement of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art
  methods.",
