  abstract = "Binaural rendering of Ambisonic signals is of great interest in
  the fields of virtual reality, immersive media, and virtual
  acoustics. Typically, the spatial order of head-related impulse
  responses (HRIRs) is considerably higher than the order of the
  Ambisonic signals. The resulting order reduction of the HRIRs has
  a detrimental effect on the binaurally rendered signals, and
  perceptual evaluations indicate limited externalization,
  localization accuracy, and altered timbre. In this contribution,
  a binaural renderer, which is computed using a
  frequency-dependent time alignment of HRIRs followed by a
  minimization of the squared error subject to a diffuse-field
  covariance matrix constraint, is presented. The
  frequency-dependent time alignment retains the interaural time
  difference (at low frequencies) and results in a HRIR set with
  lower spatial complexity, while the constrained optimization
  controls the diffuse-field behavior. Technical evaluations in
  terms of sound coloration, interaural level differences,
  diffuse-field response, and interaural coherence, as well as
  findings from formal listening experiments show a significant
  improvement of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art

abstract  = "The head related transfer function (HRTF) characterizes the
scattering properties of a person's anatomy (especially the
pinnae, head and torso), and exhibits considerable
person-to-person variability. It is usually measured as a part
of a tedious experiment, and this leads to the function being
sampled at a few angular locations. When the HRTF is needed at
intermediate angles, its value must be interpolated. Further,
its range dependence is also neglected, which is invalid for
nearby sources. Since the HRTF arises from a scattering process,
it can be characterized as a solution of a scattering problem.
In this paper, we show that by taking this viewpoint and
performing some analysis we can express the HRTF in terms of a
series of multipole solutions of the Helmholtz equation. This
approach leads to a natural solution to the problem of HRTF
interpolation. Furthermore, we show that the range-dependence of
the HRTF in the near-field can also be obtained by extrapolation
from measurements at one range.",

title    = "Microphone arrays and sound field decomposition for dynamic
binaural recording",
author   = "Bernsch{\"u}tz, Benjamin",
abstract = "This thesis discusses a field-related recording technique based
on microphone arrays and orthogonal sound field decomposition
that delivers a suitable description for dynamic binaural
reproduction. Dynamic binaural reproduction refers to a mostly
headphone-based reproduction method that allows for presenting
localizable virtual sources and accounts for the head movements
of the recipient in order to decouple them from the spatial
orientation of the virtual auditory scene. Increased source
localization and externalization stability can be regarded as
primary advantages compared to classic static binaural
reproduction. Spatially stationary or dynamic virtual sound
sources can be presented that maintain their spatial positions or
move in relation to a fixed external world coordinate system,
which is independent from the recipient's head movements. Dynamic
binaural reproduction requires either object-based audio
production or specific field-related recording techniques. The
focus of this thesis lies on the latter. Using microphone arrays
paired with orthogonal sound field decomposition appears to be a
particularly promising approach for field-related dynamic
binaural recording. It is based on an elegant, closed-form
mathematical solution and allows accounting for head-tracking in
all rotational degrees-of-freedom during the playback of a
recorded auditory scene. Theoretically, even translation of the
recipient can be considered. The method inherently comprises
individualization capabilities by employing individual
head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and allows for
point-to-multipoint distribution. Due to the close mathematical
relationship with higher-order Ambisonics (HOA), the respective
formats and codecs can be used for storage and distribution of
the audio data. The theoretical mathematical approach under ideal
physical conditions is discussed and a closed-form solution is
derived. Due to constraints in technical systems, such as
discrete spatial sampling or noise in the signal paths for
instance, ideal conditions cannot be maintained in practice. The
major constraints are pointed out and their specific impact is
analyzed and assessed. Various approaches for improving the
transmission characteristics of the system are proposed and
evaluated. The perceptual properties under dedicated technical
constraints and realistic conditions are assessed in listening
experiments. Optimal technical parameters for the system are also
determined. It turns out that an array-based system for dynamic
binaural recording with satisfying perceptual properties can be
realized within reasonable technological and economical limits.",

  abstract = "The area of sound field synthesis has significantly advanced in

  sound-field capturing and re-synthesis systems. Spherical
  microphone arrays are among the most recently developed systems
  for sound field capturing, enabling processing and analysis of
  three-dimensional sound fields in the spherical harmonics domain.
  In spite of these developments, a clear relation between sound
  fields recorded by spherical microphone arrays and their
  perception with a re-synthesis system has not yet been
  established, although some relation to scalar measures of spatial
  perception was recently presented. This paper presents an
  experimental study of spatial sound perception with the use of a
  spherical microphone array for sound recording and
  headphone-based binaural sound synthesis. Sound field analysis
  and processing is performed in the spherical harmonics domain
  with the use of head-related transfer functions and simulated
  enclosed sound fields. The effect of several factors, such as
  spherical harmonics order, frequency bandwidth, and spatial
  sampling, are investigated by applying the repertory grid
  technique to the results of the experiment, forming a clearer
  relation between sound-field capture with a spherical microphone
  array and its perception using binaural synthesis regarding
  space, frequency, and additional artifacts. The experimental
  study clearly shows that a source will be perceived more
  spatially sharp and more externalized when represented by a
  binaural stimuli reconstructed with a higher spherical harmonics
  order. This effect is apparent from low spherical harmonics
  orders. Spatial aliasing, as a result of sound field capturing
  with a finite number of microphones, introduces unpleasant
  artifacts which increased with the degree of aliasing error.",
